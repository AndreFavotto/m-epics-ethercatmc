## Contributing
Write commit messages that tell people why things happen and what
happens:
  A useful head line, max 50 characters
  An empty line
  Motivate the change, describe why and what. If alternative solutions
  may had been choosen, mention them shortly.
  The commit message should be complete, so that the reader is not forced
  to dig into the issue list to understand what is going on.
